# NEUCOGAR
NEUCOGAR project for validation of cube of NEUCOGAR architecture of affects based on 'Cube of emotions' 

1-2 stages based on:
![Dopamine pathway: schema of Albin & him colleagues](https://github.com/research-team/NEUCOGAR/blob/master/nest/step_1/BG_generators.png?raw=true)

3 stage based on:
![Dopamine pathway: advanced schema based on modern discoveries in cognitive neuroscience](https://github.com/research-team/NEUCOGAR/blob/master/nest/step_3/Basal-ganglia-advanced.jpg?raw=true)

Striatum diagram is based on [This article](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20521851 "A computational model of how cholinergic interneurons protect striatal-dependent learning.") with tonically active neurons

The next step is to get adequate weights for synapses and their count relative to a rat's brain.
